fullstackdb

Welcome

This is a full stack framework for developers .

when you use this frame worl instead of using 3 programs in a full stack , 
you should use only two , the database and the client , 
the the stored procedures are opened for the client side as apis that the client can use

And the security can be built inside the database server .
